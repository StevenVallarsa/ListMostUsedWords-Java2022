# List Most Used Words In Paragraph
A program that will:
- break a paragraph of text into an array of Strings
- iterate through the array and put each word into a HashMap
- - if word is not already in HashMap, insert it as a key with a value of 1 using PUT
- - if word does exist, add 1 to the value of that key (by using PUT again to overwrite the existing item)
- order HashMap on values
- display words with the top five occurances (there could be more than five words due to ties)
